## Details:
In this mini project, I reviewed my skills on HTML5/CSS3 -- Pure basics...
<br> I applied :

- Layout and Position concept : fixed, absolute, sticky and relative
- pseudo elements and media @ classes like ::after
- Media queries  : to make it responsive (That's really important !!!)
- Apply html5 semantics to have a better structure of a Web page.
- Html forms : at the bottom of the page
*********************************

This was a good checking before moving forward in my skills :-)
